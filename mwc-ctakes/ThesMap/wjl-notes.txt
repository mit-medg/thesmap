It seems that if T019 (Organic Chemical) or T197 (Inorganic Chemical) or T123 (Biologically Active Substance) occur in combination with other TUIs, they should be dropped as redundant.

For other combinations, it makes sense to retain multiple interpretations, e.g., T119,T121,T127 (Lipid, Pharmacologic Substance, Vitamin) describe something at three possibly useful levels of abstraction.

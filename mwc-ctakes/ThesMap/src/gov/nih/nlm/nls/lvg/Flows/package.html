<P>This package provides API of all lvg flow components.  In this version of Lexical Tools, a flow component is also called as a transformation.  Lvg transforms text via a flow. A flow is composed of several flow components. Lvg is capable of handling a flow (a series of flow components) or multiple (parallel) flows.

<p> A public method, Mutate( ), is implemented in all flow component classes and performs the feature of transforming text. This Mutate( ) method takes one LexItem as the input and returns a Vector of LexItem(s).

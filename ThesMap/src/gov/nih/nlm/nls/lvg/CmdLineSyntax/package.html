Provides Java classes necessary to create a command line system.
<P>This package provides an API for build a command line system (up to five levels).
Basically, a command is composed of program and options. An option is a linked list composed of option items.  An option item composed by option flags and option arguments.  

<p><b>Features</b>
<p>Bellows are some features of this package:
<ul>
<li>The system option can be flexibly assigned by defining a String.
<li>The syntax of an input command can be checked automatically by the system.
<li>Possible command(s) will be suggested by the system if there is an error on the input option.  Two types of system options are suggested:
	<ul>
	<li>An optionItem with same level as the input option where first error happens.
	<li>An optionItem includes the input option item where error happens.
	</ul>
<li>Each optionFlag has two names, abbreviation and full name.
<li>Provides methods for converting abbreviation name and full name of flags for optinItem.
<li>Provides methods of printing hierarchy structure of a given option.
<li>Provides methods of printing all optionItems.
	</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Usage</b>

<li> Define the system option flag by defining an option string in DefineFlag().
<li> Define all flag full name (if any) in DefineFlag() in foo.
<li> Define what to do for each option in ExecuteCommand() in foo.
